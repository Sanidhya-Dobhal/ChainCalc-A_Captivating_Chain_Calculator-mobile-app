# Chain Calc - React Native Version

This is the **React Native version** of my React project, [ChainCalc](https://github.com/Sanidhya-Dobhal/ChainCalc-A_Captivating_Chain_Calculator). With this implementation, the web-application has been transformed into an **Android and IOS application**, enhancing its **accessibility** and allowing users to use ChainCalc on phone.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Improved Accessibility**: The mobile app ensures Chain Calc is accessible to a wider audience.
- **Code Reusability**: Designed with maximum reusability of code between the React and React Native codebases.
- **Familiar Experience**: Maps both the UI and functionality of the original ChainCalc web project to maintain consistency.
